# This is Practice 1, it starts from install and create a project

## Installation of Django

1. Firstly, use the command line to install Django. Here, I used an environment named _dj_ for this practice. 
```bash
# Install Django
(dj) pineapple@pineapple % pip install django
```

## Create a Django Project
2. By using commandline: 
```bash
django-admin startproject myproject
```
